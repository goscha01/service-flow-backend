/**
 * Identity Graph Violation Emitter — architectural hardening (warn-only).
 *
 * The identity graph (`communication_participant_identities`) is the
 * authoritative source of identity linkage. CRM projections
 * (`leads.converted_customer_id`, `leads.parent_opportunity_id`, etc.) are
 * materialised from the graph by authorised writers.
 *
 * This module exists to detect — at runtime — code paths that write
 * directly to graph-owned surfaces without going through the
 * authorised writers. Stage 1 of the enforcement roadmap (see
 * docs/architecture/identity-enforcement-roadmap.md): warn-only.
 * Future stages add CI detection and runtime hard blocks.
 *
 * EMIT FORMAT (Loki-filterable):
 *
 *   [IdentityGraphViolation] kind=<kind> tenant=<id> target=<column-path>
 *                            source=<callsite> reason=<short> path=<call-stack-summary>
 *
 * VIOLATION KINDS (closed set; sync with VIOLATION_KINDS below):
 *
 *   direct_converted_customer_id_write
 *     A write to `leads.converted_customer_id` outside lib/identity-linker.js's
 *     `projectIdentityToCRM` / `applyLeadCustomerLink` / `attemptScoringFallback`.
 *
 *   direct_parent_opportunity_id_write
 *     A write to `leads.parent_opportunity_id` outside `createChildLeadFromLB` in
 *     leadbridge-service.js (the only authorised cardinality writer).
 *
 *   direct_opportunity_origin_type_write
 *     A write to `leads.opportunity_origin_type` outside the authorised LB ingest
 *     writers (`createLeadFromLB` / `createChildLeadFromLB`).
 *
 *   direct_sf_lead_id_write
 *     A direct `.update({ sf_lead_id: ... })` outside `setIdentityLead`
 *     in lib/identity-linker.js OR the fallback hydration block.
 *
 *   direct_sf_customer_id_write
 *     A direct `.update({ sf_customer_id: ... })` outside `setIdentityCustomer`
 *     in lib/identity-linker.js OR the fallback hydration block.
 *
 *   direct_identity_projection_write
 *     A generic catch-all for direct writes to communication_participant_
 *     identities columns that are graph-projection-related (sf_lead_id /
 *     sf_customer_id / last_hydrated_by / status).
 *
 *   integration_bypass
 *     An inbound integration handler reached the CRM materialisation step
 *     without consulting the reconciliation engine or the resolver. Used
 *     by adapters that detect they were called without prior resolver
 *     output.
 *
 *   operator_override_outside_linker
 *     A direct CRM-projection write performed by an operator endpoint
 *     that did not go through `applyLeadCustomerLink` (the authorised
 *     operator path).
 *
 *   transitional_bypass
 *     Acknowledged transitional bypass (migration code, retroactive
 *     repair, customer-merge operator endpoint). Emit so we have a
 *     count, but it's expected to be non-zero until the path retires.
 *
 * STAGE 1 POSTURE: this module emits warnings. It does NOT block,
 * throw, or alter behaviour. Future stages will tighten:
 *   - Stage 2: CI scanner enforces that direct writes are either
 *     allowlisted or carry an emitViolation call.
 *   - Stage 3: runtime hard block in non-test envs (set throwOnViolation
 *     env flag).
 *   - Stage 4: dead-code removal of bypass paths.
 *
 * NEVER throws. Defensive try/catch in every method so logging mistakes
 * never crash the caller.
